Teo Wei Jie and Tjong Jia Ning 

OUR PROJECT'S NAME:
T&T (formed by using the first letter of our surnames)
T&T is a e-commerce website that aims to sell clothes that are perfect for the season. By checking the weather at the location you're at, we will recommend clothes that are suitable for you. T&T sells clothes, accessories and shoes perfect for the weather. 


Design Process:
We decided to do this e-commerce website as we wanted to find ways we could help others and at the same time promote our business. thus, we decided on doing e-commerce. Our focus is to promote our shirts (products.html) which is all designed by wei jie. Additionally, we also added a weather API so that people can figure out what they want to buy based on the weather at their location. 

As a user, i would definitely want to buy clothes that are perfect for the season.
As a user, we are often distracted by the nice designs and the exotic colors of the clothes that we often forget to ask ourselves if we need them or not. Is it a want or a need? Thus having the API there to allow me to see what the weather is like will remind me that yes i need to buy shirts instead of hoodies or mask instead of shirts.
